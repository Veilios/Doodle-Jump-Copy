[Done] - All platforms are equally spaced aparted

[Done] - Doodler automatically lands where ever the first platform is

[Done] - Platforms move only when Doodler gets to a certian height

[Done] - When a platform touches the ground, it disapears, and a new one appears above

[Done] - The Doodler movements, Jumping, EventListeners, Moves up and down, stops if he hits the edges

[Done] -  Game ends when Doodler hits the floor

[Done] - Final Score, amount of platforms jumped over
